Experimenting with creating a small [FLIP](https://aerotwist.com/blog/flip-your-animations/) utility.
I tried [flipping](https://github.com/davidkpiano/flipping) and was dissatisfied with its documentation and didn't think it was very ergonomical.
I also looked at [flipjs](https://github.com/googlearchive/flipjs) but it doesn't look like it's actively maintained.
This isn't production ready by any means, it's just testing some stuff out.
